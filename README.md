# MoonShip
The MOONSHIP offers an AMM (auto market maker, i.e. decentralized swap) to exchange different tokens on the Binance Smart Chain as well as a Yield Farming platform. The organization of the project is decentralized, with different user groups self-organized into divisions. The MOONSHIP Token user group calls itself the ''PMG FAM'' and develops a strong community culture around supporting and cultivating an obsession with the crypto-verse and financial freedom.   In an effort to break away from the hyperinflationary policy that is unfortunately all too common in BEP20 token projects and leads to their devaluation, the MOONSHIP Token opts for slow and controlled issuance. The aim is to make PMG a rare, and therefore valuable asset. The issuance is BEGINS with only 0.2 PMG per block.   At it’s core, PMG MOONSHIP is a community-driven project aiming to bring a community engaged socially intrinsic value into the DeFi space. Backed by a bootstrapped community and through several partnerships and platform developments, we intend create an ecosystem around the MOONSHIP Token and to grow this friendly community. As Captian MoonGold himself will say, PMG FAM, LET'S GO! Let’s have fun, let’s shake the crypto-verse! So it's OK to be obsessed with crypto, so be part of this journey to the moon… Board the MOONSHIP today and if you play your cards right, you might get to meet the MoonPirate and grab some of his booty...
